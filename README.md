This is a simple note taking app. I got tired of other apps on the Play Store that required you to go through three different screens before you were actually able to write down your note. This one launches right into an editing screen where you can immediately capture your thought before you lose it. Hence the name.

Add, catergorize, sort, save, delete, and reverse sort functionality.
